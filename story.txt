Once upon a time there was a dog who sat by a window look outside at the other dogs in the neighborhood. The dog's name was Fido. Fido wanted to play with the other dogs on the street, but wasn't sure if the other dogs wanted to play with him. All of a sudden Fido heard a bark at the door! It was another Dog!

The name of the barking dog is Jessica, and she always wants to become friends wit Fido. But it turns out Fido's girlfriend Cindy is not happy about it, and that is the reason why she locked Fido at home and not allows other dogs to play with him.

Fido let the other dog into his house and asked his name. The new dog's name was Spot! Spot ask Fido if he wanted to play outside. Fido was so happy he finally made a friend! 


Spot and Fido headed outdoors looking for something to do. "How nice this was!" Fido thought. Soon they came across a park with tons of other dogs. Both Spot and Fido were overjoyed! They ventured into the park to play.

 At the park, Fido came across the barking dog that was once at his door, Jessica. Fido introduces Spot to Jessica and they all continue to venture the park. Soon, Spot and Jessica started dating. Fido never saw Spot again.

Once upon a time there was a dog who sat by a window look outside at the other dogs in the neighborhood. The dog's name was Fido. Fido wanted to play with the other dogs on the street, but wasn't sure if the other dogs wanted to play with him. All of a sudden Fido heard a bark at the door! It was another Dog!

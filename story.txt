Once upon a time there was a dog who sat by a window look outside at the other dogs in the neighborhood. The dog's name was Fido. Fido wanted to play with the other dogs on the street, but wasn't sure if the other dogs wanted to play with him. All of a sudden Fido heard a bark at the door! It was another Dog!

The name of the barking dog is Jessica, and she always wants to become friends wit Fido. But it turns out Fido's girlfriend Cindy is not happy about it, and that is the reason why she locked Fido at home and not allows other dogs to play with him.

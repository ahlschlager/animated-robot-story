Once upon a time there was a dog who sat by a window look outside at the other dogs in the neighborhood. The dog's name was Fido. Fido wanted to play with the other dogs on the street, but wasn't sure if the other dogs wanted to play with him. All of a sudden Fido heard a bark at the door! It was another Dog!

Fido let the other dog into his house and asked his name. The new dog's name was Spot! Spot ask Fido if he wanted to play outside. Fido was so happy he finally made a friend!
